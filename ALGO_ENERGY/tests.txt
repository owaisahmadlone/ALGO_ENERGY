Tests for testing the app docs:

1/Create Asset:

Create the following asset, The query It will return all the assets therein
  "assetID": "A014",
  "assetName": "Machine 1",
  "assetType": "Machine",
  "location": "Factory B",
  "purchaseDate": {
    "$date": "2023-02-01T18:30:00Z"
  },
  "initialCost": 63153,
  "operationalStatus": "Under Maintenance"

Now here copy the "_id" attribute of asset with assetID "A005"

2/find Asset: 
use this "_id" to find the asset 5 using find-asset-by-id

3/update Asset: Use the "_id" of asset with assetID "A005" and update it as:

    "assetID": "A005",
  "assetName": "Machine 5",
  "assetType": "Machine",
  "location": "Factory T",
  "purchaseDate": {
    "$date": "2023-02-01T18:30:00Z"
  },
  "initialCost": 63153,
  "operationalStatus": "Under Maintenance"

4/Delete asset: delete asset 5 using its "_id" as used above

5/create metric: create the following metric, you will see all the metrics in response
 "assetID": "A014",
  "uptime": 75.67,
  "downtime": 0.81,
  "maintenanceCosts": 495,
  "failureRate": 0.0101,
  "efficiency": 23.58

Now copy the "_id" attribute of metric with assetID "A004"

6/find metric: find the metric of A004 using the above "_id"

7/update metric: update metric of A004 with below metric:
    "assetID": "A004",
  "uptime": 75.67,
  "downtime": 0.91,
  "maintenanceCosts": 1005,
  "failureRate": 0.0101,
  "efficiency": 24.58

8/delete metric: delete the metric of A004  using its "_id"

Rest All the data insight functionalities like average downtime, costs and least reliable assets can be tested be tested rightaway
